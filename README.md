Start with something simple:

    Front-End {
        Page: Each page will represent a town/city each will have it's own corresponding table in the backend for it's list of hotels
            Subpages: If the town/city is large enough to have multiple known neighborhoods (ex: New York City has multiple neighborhoods like chinatown, brooklyn, etc.) and each subpage will list the hotels.

            Data of the hotels will be displayed:
                Name, Location, Accommodations, Surroundings (ex: parks, restaurants, pokestops {Maybe}, etc.), benefits
                (See if some of these hotels will be willing to partner with you later after receiving traffic hopefully)
                Use Keywords for SEO purposes. And try learning a bit more about SEO in the process.

        Obv. Using React here, Could possibly use this as an excuse to learn react-native and make a mobile app from this too.
    }

    Back-End {
        Data Structure:
            Town/City:
                Name/Location, List of hotel names, List of parks, restaurants, photos of city and skyline

                Hotels:
                    Name, location, surroundings, accommodations, photos of hotel/lobby, site link(if applicable), phone number, hours of service.

                A table of accommodations could be provided to be used as tags or something similar.

            E-mail collection:
                e-mail, name, niche data
                    Niche Data:
                        Categorized data about which niches individuals like. I need to come up with a list of niches to use for this. Maybe I can use a keyword dictionary or something to make this.

        Do I do this in Node? or Python?
    }

First I need to compile a list of key searches to figure out a starting point. Then collect the data to create a substantial database to use from the beginning. Then create the app using React. I need to implement a niche survey, and an e-mail collection system in the backend. Maybe I can make a bot that will read the data, and write it to a local file for additional uses like e-mail marketing.

First thing is first: Collect Key search phrases!
